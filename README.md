# Inflation Nowcast Bot
This repo stores data and code for the (unofficial) *Inflation Nowcast Twitter Bot*. (Include hyperlink to bot later.)

## What is this?
This Twitter bot posts the [Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's](https://www.clevelandfed.org/) official [CPI inflation nowcast](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) for upcoming [CPI releases](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/), first on the last day of the relevant calendar month and then the night before the official release.

## Why make this?
1. This was something I thought would be useful but did not find in existence.
2. It did not appear the Cleveland Fed had an API and primarily released raw data/forecasts via its [webpage](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting).
3. Official Twitter accounts like [@ClevelandFed](https://twitter.com/ClevelandFed) and [@ClevFedResearch](https://twitter.com/ClevFedResearch) did not appear to be sharing nowcasts via Twitter, versus sharing results of the actual releases themselves.
4.
