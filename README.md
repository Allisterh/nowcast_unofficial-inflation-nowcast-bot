# Inflation Nowcast Bot
This repo stores data and code for the (unofficial) *Inflation Nowcast Twitter Bot*. (Include hyperlink to bot later.)

## What is this?
This Twitter bot posts the [Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's](https://www.clevelandfed.org/) official [CPI inflation nowcast](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting) for upcoming [CPI releases](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/), first on the last day of the relevant calendar month and then the night before the official release.

## Why make this?
A few reasons:
1. This was something I thought would be useful but did not find in existence at the time.
2. It did not appear the Cleveland Fed had an API and released raw data/forecasts via its [webpage](https://www.clevelandfed.org/indicators-and-data/inflation-nowcasting).
